        People will come to the String Savers site to find trustworthy places to go to buy low-cost and great-quality instruments. They will come to this site because it can be hard to find reliable and cost effective instruments online. By having this site curated and frequently updated they can always know for certain that they are finding the best deals from the most trustworthy sites in the online musical instrument market.
        Visitors to the site may have many questions they expect the site to answer. The most important question being “Where can I find quality used instruments for low prices?”. My website will answer this question by showing them all of the best places online to find these quality and low-cost instruments.

      </ul>
      <h3>Recognizing A Good Deal</h3>
      <p>
        Another important question might be, “How do I know I am getting a good deal?”. My website can help address this question by having a space with common things to look out for in used instruments. It can also inform users on how to compare instrument prices so that they know they are getting the best deal possible on the site of their choosing. 

	      In order to use the site visitors will not need to know much. The only things the site needs for the visitor is a desire to find a musical instrument! The visitor may already have some background knowledge of musical instruments, but this site will allow even those with no knowledge of musical instruments to find a quality and low cost instrument for themselves. 

        Visitors will come to this site as opposed to others because it will always have up to date information, and it will help users along the whole process of buying a new instrument. Many websites currently have lists showing good places to buy used instruments for cheap, and while String Savers will have a list like that, ours will be frequently updated. 

        We also will have a large amount of information on ensuring you find a good deal that other sites don’t have. These others sites only show other sites while ours will direct to other sites along with information about those sites and information on how to buy a used musical instrument.

      <h3>Satisfied Customers</h3>
      <p>
        Another question they may have is if the website actually works. This is why there will be a page dedicated to showing the instruments other users have found using this site. This page will be a curated list of users with the instruments they have found and their praise for the site in helping them find that instrument.

	      Visitors may also trust this site more than others because it shows the outcomes of satisfied users. They can view the instruments that other users found and see the price that those users got the instrument for. These photos may also contain a review of the site which can help further it’s credibility and show how it stands out against other sites. Showing the purchases price will also help the user obtain a meaningful reference point for the prices they can expect their particular instrument to be.

	      Visitors will also have a section at the bottom of the tips to buy a new instrument where they can ask a question to the site owner. This will allow the owner to respond to their questions, and if they get asked enough the owner could add that specific question into the tips for buying used instruments. This way the site will always be updated with the information that is most important to the users at any given time. Visitors will know that this site is really trying to help the understand the process of buying a new instrument and that it will help them find the best deal.
